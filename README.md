## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned


- How to properly center layouts using `flexbox` and `min-height: 100vh`
- Managing overflow and border-radius together using `overflow: hidden`
- Creating responsive layouts that switch from column to row smoothly
- Writing cleaner and more maintainable CSS for UI components



### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve accessibility (focus states, contrast checks)
- Practice pixel-perfect layouts
- Explore subtle animations and transitions
